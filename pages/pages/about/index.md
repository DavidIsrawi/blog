I am a Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida. I am interested in the field of Neuro-linguistic Programming, Machine Learning, and data analytics overall, so I have invested my time in exploring these fields. In my free time, I like to play video games, play a number musical instruments, and hang out with friends. I also enjoying playing and refereeing different sports, primarily soccer, dodgeball and ping-pong.
