## AllTheFeels

Amazon's Alexa skill prompts the user how his/her day is going, then it curates a list of regularly-updated Spotify playlists tailored to the person's mood. Worked on incorporating the AlchemyAPI to the response from Alexa, then sorting a list of playlist in accordance to the sentiment in the person's day.

## SummarizeMe

On the server side, the program is written in Python using the NLTK library, it's made into a RESTful API using Flask and deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. On the client side, the application is written using Angular and deployed to GitHub Pages using angular-cli-ghpages. Project inspired by the auto TL;DR bot used in many subreddits.
